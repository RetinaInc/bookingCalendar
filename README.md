# bookingCalendar
Room-booking front end based on Material Design - For Drupal 7 Module

This repo contains only the front end interactions.
* bookingCalendar is a form built on top of fullCalendar.

### Stateful
* The form mechanism is encapsulated within a stateful object with all the necessary methods and K/V pairs built within it.
Functions, in their normal sense, are kept to a minimum and they primarily exist to serve trivial matters for the object itself.


### Todo's:
* Minimize DOM manipulation even more.
* All dates currently use the ISO8601 standard but a lot of flip-floppings happen at various stages, in terms of format switching. These need to be consolidated and generated by a Single-Point-of-Truth.
